    <td colspan=2 class="greenbox bigtext" >Computer Device Production
        <p class="smalltext">The manufacturing, shipping, usage, and disposal of computers consume a lot of energy that is usually generated from burning fossil fuels. This greatly contributes to the global warming crisis as huge amounts of greenhouse gases are released. Burning of fossil fuels is the largest contributor to greenhouse gas emissions and the production of computers directly play a hand in it. Inside these devices are precious materials and are often found through unjust labor. The refinement of these materials is also often extremely expensive and energy-intensive. They are also usually just disposed of in landfills when they can easily be recycled and reused.

     <td colspan=2 class="whitebox bigtext"> Raw Materials
          <p class="smalltext">Raw materials are first extracted from the Earth through mining. Most types of mining are not ethical for the Earth as they strip large amounts of habitat from the nearby ecosystems. A single computer alone requires over 30 different materials that are non-renewable so long-term plans to continue computer production with this same process are not sustainable. Once they've been mined out they have to be manufactured for them to be usable and this is done through a very intensive process. These materials are shipped throughout the whole world adding to the energy costs of transportation on top of everything else previous to this step.

    <td colspan=2 class="greenbox bigtext">Computer Device Usage
        <p class="smalltext"> Every gigabit of data that is transmitted online consumes a lot of energy. This single-handedly creates a lot of greenhouse gas emissions because there is such a high demand for the production of energy. Itâ€™s required for when a device is charging and to run operating servers, networks, and data centers. The equipment needed for these networks also has to be maintained, upgraded as technology progresses, or disposed of. This means that even more material, energy, and labor are needed just to keep our usage of the internet working properly. This process of manufacturing, transporting, installing, operating, upgrading, and disposing leads to a critical issue that going under the radar and unnoticed by most people.
