    <td colspan=3 class="whitebox" >Computer Device Production
        <p class="smalltext">Manufacturing, shipping, usage, and disposal of computers consume a lot of energy that is usually generated from the burning of fossil fuels. This greatly contributes to the global warming crisis as huge amounts of greenhouse gases are released. Burning of fossil fuels is the largest contributor to greenhouse gas emissions. Inside these devices are precious materials that are often found through unfair labor. Refining these materials is also often a huge contributor to greenhouse emissions.</p>

    <td colspan=3 class="greenbox bigtext">Computer Device Usage
        <p class="smalltext"> Every gigabit of data that is transmitted online consumes a lot of energy. This singlehandedly creates a lot of greenhouse gas emissions to produce the energy needed. Energy is also consumed when a device is charging, or operating servers, networks, and data centers. The equipment needed for networks also has to be maintained, upgraded, or disposed of which means more material, energy, and labor are needed. Manufacturing, transporting, installing, operating, upgrading, and disposing of produce even more greenhouse emissions.</p>

    <td colspan=3 class="whitebox" >Computer Device Disposal
        <p class="smalltext">17.4% of electronic waste contains a mixture of harmful substances found in our waste which goes to landfills that directly contaminate our land and water. We produce over 62 billion kg of e-waste every year with very little parts of it being recycled and properly handled. E-waste is toxic and non-biodegradable that continues to build up in our environment if we don't do anything about it. Our current practices for disposing of E-waste can release toxic materials that leach onto the environment, degrading it over time. Our improper handling of e-waste has caused a huge loss in scarce and valuable materials as well as poisoning the planet that we live on. This has also been a huge contributor to litter worldwide as landfills are being filled to the brim with e-waste.</p>
