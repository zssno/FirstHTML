        <p class="smalltext">Computer devices are one of the biggest contributors to greenhouse gas emissions and e-waste as it contains multiple toxic chemicals. In just 2019 alone we have generated over 53 million tons of e-waste that is harmful to the environment and human health. Computer devices' very existence is a form of greenhouse gas emission as the production and disposal of these devices require a lot of energy and valuable materials. The usage of computers is also damaging to the environment as you have to maintain, manage, and upgrade networks and servers.
